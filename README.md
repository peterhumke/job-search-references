job-search-references
=====================

Reference material I found during my job search.  When it comes to articles I included a bunch of sites, some more reputable than others with the thought that a lot of these places touch on the same topics, and it can always be useful to have more research material than too little.

## Cover Letters

My original cover letters were written to demonstrate some value that didn't seem to come across enough in the resume.  It demonstrated an actual example of something that I did well.  In my later ones (round 2+) I realized that the cover letter just gets you in the door, but has no bearing on tech skills, so I wrote it less techincally and more just to get the attention of the recruiter.

### How To



### Active vs Passive Voice

* [Duke.edu][cl_duke] - An explaination of the two voices, pros and cons to each, why and how to avoid using one
* [Cornell.edu][cl_cornell] - A word doc giving a list of action verbs to use when need to rewrite something from passive to active (so sentences don't become repetitive)
* [Unc.edu][cl_unc]
* [QuickAndDirtyTips][cl_qad]
* [Chronicle][cl_chron] - Intersting read, although less beneficial for rules of thumb
